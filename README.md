The template I use for making LaTeX notes

## What is `yeah.png`?

I use it to end proofs and statements (similar to a blacksquare).
It started off as an inside joke as one of my professors had a habit of saying
"Yeah!" at the end of his proofs.
Being the enterprising university students that we were, we were "inspired" by
him and immediately started closing our own proofs in the same manner.
